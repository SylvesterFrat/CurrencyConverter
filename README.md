# CurrencyConverter
This is a simple Currency Converter chrome extension I made using html, css and javascript. The program converts between 19 currencies worldwide and the calculations include exhcange rates pulled from a Rapid API as well as some simple math to calculate the final value.

To use this program:
- Create a Rapid API account and get a key for the Currency Exchange Rate API
- Clone this repository and create a new config.js file with your API key instead.
- Upload this code to the Google Chrome
- Enjoy!
